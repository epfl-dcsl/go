\subsection{SGX description}

IS THAT NECESSARY?

\subsection{SGX spectrum in research}

From putting the entire operating system to just code.
Operating system inside the enclave~\cite{DBLP:journals/tocs/BaumannPH15}.
Container inside the enclave~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/ArnautovTGKMPLM16}.
Framework deployment of computation inside the enclave~\cite{DBLP:conf/sicherheit/UblerGM18}.
Browser plugins~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1805-01548}.
Code partitioning according to static analysis of tagged data~\cite{DBLP:conf/osdi/ArnautovTGKMPLM16}.
Rust library that exposes an API to directly interact with the SGX technology[CITE].
But no direct integrating as part of the language with semantics supporting it.

\subsection{SGX in industry}

I THINK EVERYBODY GAVE UP THIS PART...

\subsection{The Go programming language}

Memory managed strongly typed.
Based on CSP style.
Light-weight routines and native typed channels.
Routines scheduled on top of a pool of OS threads.
Channels with copy semantics.
